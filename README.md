# DSA Library

NOTE: This repository is a constant work in progress.

A collection of as many data structures and algorithms as I know of. I am building this repository to sharpen my software engineering skills. My current goal is to compile a list of data structures and algorithms, and first implement them in **_Typescript_**, then **_Rust_** and possibly **_Go_**.

## What's implemented

✅ - implemented

❌ - not yet implemented
