# DSA Library

This is a collection of majority widely used data structures and algorithms. Including every single data structure and algorithm would be impossible, so I will not include some of the less known ones. I will also not include ones that I deem unneccesary for any reason.

I am building this collection to sharpen my software engineering skills. Currently, I am writing everything in **_Typescript_**. After that, I plan to rewrite everything in **_Rust_** since I want to learn the language anyway and gain a better understanding of lower-level concepts. I also might create a DSA course based on this repo sometime in the future, but that's just an idea for now.
